# vyper_tesseract_workshop

Workshop steps:

- Setting up an environment: Python, uv, moccasin
- Making & deploying an ERC20 token with modules (snekmate)
- Making a factory contract with Blueprints (TokenFactory)
- Making a memecoin factory contract with Quickswap liquidity pools
- Writing tests
- Putting it all together: Using OpenAI's API and functions to make an agent

Ideas to implement for small contest:

- Make the amount of liquidity deployed dynamic based on how strong the agent thinks the meme's potential is
- Use another source instead of news like Solana memecoin deployments
- Do NFTs instead of ERC20
- Add interactivity to the agent: people send ETH and ask on Twitter with a signature to prove ownership
